# Stock/Crypto Data Retriever

This simple yet compact code lets users download _stock/crypto_ data from _YahooFinance_ and save the data as **xlsx file** for each **_ticker symbol_**. The Python file has a self-contained validity confirming code that checks whether the ticker symbol given by the user is accurate. 

#### Libraries to Install Before Use:

You will need _yfinance_ and _pandas_ installed in your environment. Once you open your command line and activate your environment, you should run the following commands:

> pip install yfinance

> pip install pandas
